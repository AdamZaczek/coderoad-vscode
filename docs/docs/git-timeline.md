A CodeRoad tutorial runs on Git commits. These will be the commits on the version branch of a repo.

1. INIT
   - Basic project setup code
   - test runner dependencies
   - .vscode workspace configurations
2. 1.1
   - add unit tests
   - add unit testing dependencies
   - add scaffolding code (if needed)
3. 1.1S
   - the code required to make the tests pass

Then repeat steps 2 & 3.

The commit messages for these must start with a level & step number. "1.1" stands for "Lesson 1 Step 1 Setup" and "1.1S" stand for "Lesson 1 Step 1 Solution". The `1.1` part of each commit message needs to match the ID's from the markdown and yaml.

You can add additional text after those required characters if you want.
